# Analysis of Algorithms (AA)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Sunny-Kumar-1/AA)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the **Analysis of Algorithms (AA)** repository. This collection is designed to house resources, notes, and implementations related to the design and analysis of computer algorithms.

The content is structured sequentially, covering fundamental paradigms and advanced topics in algorithmic studies.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into numbered directories corresponding to major algorithmic topics:

* **[1. Introduction to Algorithm/](./1.%20Introduction%20to%20Algorithm/)**
    * Foundational concepts, asymptotic notation (Big O, Omega, Theta), and basic algorithm analysis techniques.
* **[2. Divide and Conquer/](./2.%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/)**
    * Algorithms that solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search).
* **[3. Greedy Method/](./3.%20Greedy%20Method/)**
    * Approaches that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum (e.g., Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, Fractional Knapsack).
* **[4. Dynamic Programming/](./4.%20Dynamic%20Programming/)**
    * Techniques for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant computations (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack 0/1, Longest Common Subsequence).
* **[5. Graph Traversal Algrothim/](./5.%20Graph%20Traversal%20Algrothim/)**
    * Fundamental algorithms for exploring graph structures, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
* **[6. Backtracking/](./6.%20Backtracking/)**
    * Algorithmic techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems by trying to build a solution incrementally and abandoning solutions that fail to satisfy constraints (e.g., N-Queens problem).
* **[7. Branch and Bound/](./7.%20Branch%20and%20Bound/)**
    * Optimization techniques used for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
* **[8. NP Hard and NP Complete/](./8.%20NP%20Hard%20and%20NP%20Complete/)**
    * Theory of computation regarding problem complexity classes, reducibility, and understanding the limits of efficient algorithms.
